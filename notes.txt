Been having a personal renaissanceof self, working on this. 

As an artist, I favor novelty, new life experiences, good or bad (though bad only in small doses). Realized that with this framing, much of how I spend my life is various forms of experiencing art. And some of the best art is the art that inspires me to create art. It's the warmer side of looking at something and saying "I can do that". I can! and you can too! It might require an obstacle course of tricks you gotta clambor through to get to something you'd call an ending. I'm lucky to have stuck with it love enough that I've made this, and I feel pretty proud of it.

Anyway, this was a lot of fun, I hope you enjoy!
