Junior, Be Careful! | God Game Chronicles | Season 3, Episode 19, City Tournament Arc

As an artist, I favor novelty, new life experiences, good or bad (though bad only in small doses). Realized that with this framing, much of how I spend my life is various forms of experiencing art. And some of the best art is the art that inspires me to create art. It's the warmer side of looking at something and saying "I can do that". I can! and you can too! It might require an obstacle course of tricks you gotta clambor through to get to something you'd call an ending. I'm lucky to have stuck with it love enough that I've made this, and I feel pretty proud of it.

Anyway, this was a lot of fun, I hope you enjoy!

Secret Details for this video:
- XX:XX homestuck discourse in the background
- XX:XX big hippo, the GOAT
- XX:XX the deltarune character doesn't actually get hurt, but does run away. They are LOST, and Junior can no longer have them as recruits.
- after fending off Travis Touchdown, Junior loses the wrist band on their right wrist
- Yogurt uses their clown ability to re-roll coin flips for a sleep affect
- all character cards (that is, summoned beings that aren't real people) have a thick colored outline. Junior, having amalgamated with Darth Vader, has a rougher version of this when in radiant fury mode

RNDEBUG todo: 
* Add more baby accoutremants to the cloaked characters
* If there's time, replace all copy-paste art with your own
