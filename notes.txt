Been having a personal renaissance, working on this. 

The point of life is to live, the point of persisting is to live a full life, what counts as "full" is gonna change depending on the person and their values.
As an artist, I favor novelty, new life experiences, good or bad (though bad only in small doses). Realized that with this framing, much of how I spend my life is various forms of experiencing art. And some of the best art is the art that inspires me to create art. It's the warmer side of looking at something and saying "I can do that". I can! and you can too! It might require an obstacle course of tricks you gotta clambor through to get to something you'd call an ending. For me it started with ways to turn off the critical parts of my brain to allow me to start, and lately it's been cutting up a project into smaller pieces, and getting more comfortable with stuff that looks "off", that it looking "off" is a good instead of a bad thing.

Anyway, this was a lot of fun, I hope you enjoy!
