Big attack aimed at Yogurt, camera zooms in on his face, which is smiling smugly. He flips a card to defemd against the blast, which says "nuh uh". The card dissolves, and the attack dissapates
Maybe the card sacrifices clowns to work
Yogurt wins a fight by getting their dude to hug their opponent. Because they are grappled, they can't play any cards, win by forfeit

Yogurt and Junior have a heart to heart. Junior just really wants to win but the pressure is exhausting, Yogurt lets them know they arr enoigh as they are.

Bingo and Dell-Vin argue, mostly on how Bungo smells, how he has money but through illicit means, Dell Vin gets into sociopolitical class arguments witb Bingo

Aurora just hangs out. Takes photos... maybe when they get a clue and return to a room, the photo helps reveal a hidden passage? Or the presence of a mimic?

Aurora flinging out cards, eyes closed out of fear, lots of items getting used.
Aurora gets a single summon eventually, something like a plush toy you'd win at a carnival, something that feels like a giftshop item.

Dungeon crawling? Like they're an adventuring party
Dell-vin thr butler is like, a bard? support focused cards and speed
Bingo is a barbarian, generates money often but also fights with money
Junior is a warcaster, their fight as their card instead of commanding them like a pokemon trainer (amalgamated)
Aurora is a ranger, picks cards that are easy to understamd, jhigh quality but few of them
Yogurt is a wizard, lots of combo's and gotcha's







Read out a long acronym phonetically, editors not translates it to what it mrans

Look up urbandale iowa, use photos of the place for background (greyscale and fuzzy?)


I think I want Aurora and Yogurt to fight together, Yogurt is proficient but cadual, which plays off of Aurora's fear, Yogurt weaves around Aurora's covering fire to get attacks off













Hyper link music video, yogurt pacifies a junior that's gone berzerk, teleports thwm to space to cool off, then tgey with aurora fall horizontally towards a mansion of the final bpss, maybe bingo has a coins instead of health damage shield, which junior uses to prote r themswlves adls they flong themselves to the final voss

Intro: ens of anime, show their path around, X's with big fights, show total number of players go down over time.. but still a lot (map of the vity, naturally)

Dell-Vin narrating: It's been a long journey, but we're coming upon the zenith of the first inaugural God Game City Tournament

A major group of players solidifies their advantage: the kindergarteners. (Show some wacky characters that look hard, but have a pacofier/bibs)

As a group they have a special ability (show a child hold out their hands): the battle may start with 1 form of physical contact. This is meant to allow giving a hug, but they use it to get a first strike! (Kid gets bump on head and X's for eyes). Except for our hero's, nearly all other players have been felled, (show scary baby, looking at a card) or forced to join this group, due to their overwhelming advantage (hold up a super power bullet bill card that does like 15 damage). What hope do our players have of winning? One of them certainly has an idea... (top down shot zooming in to fade into opening shot)

Opening shot: mansion in the distance, bunch of people milling about, some fighting, most looking dangerous (but have a bib on or a sucker thing)

Junior yells out, "there's just so damn many of them!". The crew is defensive, backed into a corner. Maybe little character portraits for each, showong off their kit (aurora, items (healing, attacks), no summons. Yogurt, denial (sleep, teleportation) but low damage. Bingo, defense, (taunt, money instead of health specofocally) no attack. Junior, attack, amalgamated, easily manipulated)


Junior: Maid of Space
Darth Vader: Heir of Time
Yogurt: Sylph of Heart
Dell-vin: Page of Life
Bingo Taxpayer: Prince of Light
Aurora: Seer of Void

Aurora: "oh jeez oh g-gosh... I don't think I have enough cards for all of them..."
Yogurt: "hehe, not how I thought this would go, but aint that how it always is?"
Bingo: grumbling indistinctly, or maybe counting, "467, 473, or, no, 472, 477,"
Junior: "ah, TITWIEB*" *This Is The Worst It's Ever Been

 They pull out a card or two, to make them berzerk and fast or something like that, musoc starts to pile in, They'll say they to themselves "looks like we've finally run outta options..."
Cut to someone (diana) looking at a monitor of junior... smiles :] (and gibbons is there?????)
Yogurt might notice and say "WAIT, JUNIOR-", but in reaction Junior slaps the cards against them, lines up with the drop (remember a flashing lights warning when the beat drops)

Jumping through an explosion woth the vader mask on, junior Flying forward with the lightsaber. Tossing out big summons and then leaving them behind, very chaotic and draining their cards down.l, swinging the sword and cutting people down, for a ehile
Cut to aurora, Bingo, and yogurt running to catch up, music still heard but quieter. Yogurt is maybe on kirby's star, floating besides instead of running?
"Yogurt, what's going on? I thought we were losing???"
Cut to yogurt's mask, looking concerned. Zip to Junior, who downs someone, then takes a hit, their health being reduced, junior winces breifly before they lash out.
"Junior is losing themselves..." yogurt says disquietingly
"Aurora, I need some of your items!"
Cut back to junior for more fighting, before the break yogurt slaps them on the back and they teleport into the stratosphere

360 shot with them and the mask askew, looking on in wonder
They start to fall when yogurt falls in line behind them. They grasp their shoulder, with a bonkum or whatever card, that dissolves into healing green light.
Yogurt: "you did good, vades, but we're in this together. Take some deep breathes." Junior closes their eyes as the wind whips at them harder.
Yogurt flies ahead of them and throws out a triangular portal, through which we can see the mansion. There's a shpt of the grinning woman, face in dark, looking out from their throne through their front door (lots of people around scrambling), where she can see the portal from the earth side. She leans forward, one of here eyes becoming visie, as her grin turns more wicked.
At the next drop, yogurt and Junior fly through the portal. Junior grabs Bingo roughly at the same time as he's kicking a fufe in the face, and yogurt grabs aurora in a hug, big smiles from both of them
We see Yogurt fly off and spin into a ball, they bounce then throw out their hands at the same time as a bunch of people become in frame (like a timestop thing). Coins are flipped, and half of them get a quick spinning clown thijg before they'rr flipped again, most people end up with a bunch of Z's on them
Cut to Aurora who's on the star, flinging bombs and pickaxes and stuff, ends with her dual wielding 2 miniguns with her eyes closed, scared but shooting up a bunch of people
Cut to junior, who's surfing on Bingo. He keeps ticking down money. Junior is waving their sword more still, dodging as much as they're attacking.
Cut to yogurt who blocks a hyperbeam with a "nuh uh" card before jumping off of a guys head
Junior slides to a stop, focus on her feet, cut to the group ends up at the foot of stairs leading up to the mansion, looking defiant (except for bingo who's on the ground dazed, leaking money)



Todo: add population losses to first bit
Add baby grabbing hammer for retaliation
Update text to explain that qeakness to pre-emptive strike goes both ways/explain how normally a match had to be agreed

Add a bit where darth vader encourages going berzerk, "search your feel8ngs, you know it to be true" "also can we get a kitkat at the next opportunity? I would much enjoy it. Perchance."
